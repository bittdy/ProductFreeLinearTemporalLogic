% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
We consider the collaboration under compact coupled task specifications of a multiagent system that consists of heterogeneous groups of homogeneous agents. To fight the extreme computational complexity of centralized multi-agent planning, we propose a decentralized solution, where couple-edge is proposed to eliminate the coupling among compact task and transform the collaboration issue into a local task planning problem. Meanwhile, we adapt the online coordination scheme based on real-time exchange of request and reply messages to ensure the satisfaction of task specifications without central coordination. This adapted online coordination scheme facilitates not only decreasing the total execution cost but also dispatching agents to strive to complete task when part of agents failure. Proposed approach is demonstrated by a simulated scenario of 14 agents under compact coupled task specifications.

\section{Preliminaries}

\subsection{Linear Temporal Logic}
Atomic propositions (AP) are boolean variables that can be either true or false and the ingredients of an linear temporal logic are a set of atomic propositions and several boolean and temporal operators, which are specified according to the following syntax[add ref]: $\varphi\ $$:$$:$$=\top\ |\ a\ |\ \varphi_1\wedge\varphi_2\ |\ ????\varphi\ |\ \bigcirc\varphi\ |\ \varphi_1\cup\varphi_2\ |\ ???fangxing\ |\ ???lingxing\ |\ ???jiantou$, where $\top\ ???$, $a\ \in AP$, $\bigcirc$ (???), $\cup$ (???), $ ???fangxing$ (???),  $??? lingxing$ (???), $???jiantou$ (???), and $\cup$ (). We refer the readers to [add ref] to grasp the detailed semantics of LTL. We consider $\ \cup\ $, $\Longrightarrow$ and $\wedge$ in this paper which can combine the atomic propositions of different agents, thus generating the compact coupling task.


\subsection{B\"{u}chi Automaton}
Given a LTL formula $\varphi$, we can always translate it to a Nondeterministic B\"{u}chi Automaton (NBA) $\mathcal{A}_\varphi$ that accepts all the languages that satisfy $\varphi$. It is defined as $\mathcal{A}_\varphi=\ (Q,2^{AP},\delta,Q_0,\mathcal{F})$, where $Q$ is a finite set of all the states of B\"{u}chi Automaton, $2^{AP}$ is the set of alphabets, $\delta:\ Q\times 2^{AP}\rightarrow 2^Q$ is the transition relation and $\mathcal{F}\subseteq Q$ is the set of accepting states of B\"{u}chi Automaton. There are fast translation algorithms[add ref] to obtain $\mathcal{A}_\varphi$ from LTL formula $\varphi$.

\section{Problem Formulation}
We consider a multiagent system organized by $N\geq1$ agents. Each agent has the capabilities of navigating within the workspace and performing various motions. The agent index is denoted by $\mathcal{I}=\{p_i,i=1,2,...,N\}$. Then, we divide all the agents into different subsets according to their local LTL task specifications, which implies that only agents with the same local LTL task specifications can be divided into one subset. Assume there are $M$ subsets after dividing, denoted by $\mathcal{G}=\{g_j,j=1,2,...,M\}$. $\mathcal{G}$ satisfies: $g_s\subseteq \mathcal{I},\ \cup_{g_t\subseteq \mathcal{G}}g_t\ =\ \mathcal{I}$ and $g_s\cap g_t\ =\ \emptyset$, $\forall g_t,g_s \subseteq \mathcal{G}$.
\subsection{Motion Abstraction}
Each agent only knows part of the full workspace which guarantee the completeness of local task and collaboration task. huan jing bao han X ge partition, biao shi wei:   jie shao FTS gai nian

\subsection{Compact Coupled Task Specification}
In this paper we consider the compact coupled task specification. Compared to loosely coupled task specifications, compact coupled task specifications relevant to the motions of two or more agents tightly, thus can't be translated to B\"{u}chi Automaton only according to the local agent model and action specification as previous method[add ref]. The compact coupled task specification takes an recursive definition as following.
\par
\emph{Definition 1:} Given a LTL formula $\varphi$ contains temporal operators such as $\cup \ $, $\Longrightarrow$ and  $\wedge$, we denote the terms around each temporal operators by $t^{left}_i$ and $t^{right}_i$, respectively. if $t^{left}_i$ and $t^{right}_i$ belongs to $AP$ of different agents or one of them is a compact coupled task specification, then we say $\varphi$ is a compact coupled task specification.
\par
In other words, a compact coupled task specification should combine the motions of different agents through $\cup \ $, $\Longrightarrow \ $, $\wedge$ so that we can't translate it to B\"{u}chi Automaton and synthesize an initial motion plan for each agent. In summary, we consider following problem.

\emph{Problem 1:}  Given the complete agent model $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}$ and a serious of task specifications $\varphi$ which contain compact coupled task specifications, design a decentralized collaboration scheme such that $\varphi$ is fulfilled for all $p_i \ \subseteq \ \mathcal{I}$.
\section{Decentralized Initial Plan Synthesis}
In this section, we will demonstrate how we decouple the compact coupled task specifications through a set of special edge called couple-edge. Then we use the decoupled B\"{u}chi Automaton to synthesize an initial motion plan for each agent.
\subsection{Decoupling the Compact Coupled Task}
We consider the basic compact coupled task such as $\varphi_1 \cup (\varphi_2 \wedge \varphi_3)$ and $\varphi_1 \Longrightarrow \bigcirc(\varphi_2 \wedge \varphi_3)$, the nested compact coupled task can be transform to basic terms through utilizing auxiliary words. For example, we can transform $\varphi_1 \cup (\varphi_2 \Longrightarrow \bigcirc \varphi_3)$ into $\varphi_1 \cup \kappa$ and $\kappa=\varphi_2 \Longrightarrow \bigcirc \varphi_3$.
\par
Towards basic compact coupled task specification, we notice that compact coupling only exists in the task cooperation process and neither the motions nor states of agent directly participate in the construction of complete models of other agents. For example, consider compact coupled task specification $!\varphi_1\cup\varphi_2$, according to definition 1, $\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2$ belongs to different complete agent models. Consider the local complete agent model $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}$, of which the state set is $Q_c^{p_i}$ that $\varphi_1 \in Q_c^{p_i}|_{\mathcal{M}}$, and $\varphi_2 \notin Q_c^{p_i}|_{\mathcal{M}} $. There exists a subset of $Q_c^{p_i}$ denoted by $\epsilon$ that $\varphi_1 \in \epsilon |_{\mathcal{M}}$ and $\varphi_1 \notin Q_c^{p_i} \setminus \epsilon |_{\mathcal{M}}$. Then there is no edge from $Q_c^{p_i} \setminus \epsilon$ to $\epsilon$ so that we can't synthesize an initial motion plan fulfill $\varphi$.\par
\emph{Definition 2:} Given a complete agent model $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}$, If two nodes $q_i$, $q_j$ satisfy following properties:
\par
(1) $q_i \in \epsilon$, $q_j \in Q_c^{p_i} \setminus \epsilon$ or vice versa.\par
(2) $\delta(q_i,q_j)\subseteq sym(\varphi_c)$ or $\delta(q_j,q_i)\subseteq sym(\varphi_c)$.\par
where $\varphi_c$ denote the compact coupled part of task specification $\varphi$ and $sym(\varphi)$ denote all the atomic proposition of $\varphi$.
We call each edge which connects $q_i$ and $q_j$ the couple-edge.
At first we can assume that all the collaborative agents have provided assistance and add all the couple-edge to the local complete agent model, then we can synthesize an initial motion plan for each agent.\par
We adapt previous local product algorithm[add ref] which combines the FTS and B\"{u}chi Automaton of single agent for finding out all the couple-edge with respect to the compact coupled task specification $\varphi_c$ and add them into the origin complete agent model. Applying algorithm 1 we can get a new complete agent model $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}_n$ for each agent, which contains $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}$ and all the couple-edges.\par

          \State $D=D-c_i$;
          \State $E_n=E_n+c_i$;
        \EndWhile
        \label{code:recentEnd}
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
\emph{Lemma 1:} By adding all the couple-edges found out by applying algorithm 1 to $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}$, we can synthesize an initial accepted motion plan for each agent.\par
\emph{proof:} According to algorithm 1, the nodes in $Q_c^{p_i} \setminus \epsilon$ are connected because these nodes are correspond to independent task specifications. Through adding couple-edges into $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}$, each node in $\epsilon$ becomes reachable and $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}_n$ becomes fully connected. Consequently, there must exist spanning trees for $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}_n$ and there must exist a path from any initial node in $\Phi_0^{p_i}$ to any accepted node in $\Phi_A^{p_i}$. So we can synthesize an initial motion plan fulfilling $\varphi_c$ according to $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}_n$.

\emph{Lemma 2:} This decentralized initial plan synthesis method has solutions as long as original centralized plan synthesis method has solutions.\par
\emph{Proof:} In algorithm 1 we assume that all the collaborative agents have provided assistance and add all the couple-edges into $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}$. Then towards $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}$, $\varphi_c$ is no longer a constraint. The constraint becomes $\varphi \setminus \varphi_c$. Assume we synthesize an initial motion plan $R$ applying original centralized plan synthesis method, $R$ fulfills $\varphi$ and then $R$ must fulfill $\varphi \setminus \varphi_c$, so all the solutions generated by original centralized method are contained in the solutions generated by decentralized method. Consequently, the proposed decentralized initial plan synthesis method has solutions as long as original centralized plan synthesis method has solutions.
\section{Decentralized Task Collaboration}
In previous section, we assume that all the collaborative agents have provided assistance and add all the couple-edges into $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}$, which permits us to synthesize an initial motion plan for each agent. If each agent runs on its own local path independently without any communication with other agents, there may be no guarantee that the collaborative task will be completed, which may result in a violation of the task specification $\varphi$. In response to this issue, we adapt the online coordination scheme to ensure the completion of the collaborative task.
\subsection{Planning In Speed Matching Horizon}
In order to reduce the complexity of task collaboration, we apply a receding horizon method for each agent. Consider the initial reconstituted motion plan $\varrho^{p_i}$ previous, assume the current position of agent $p_i$ is $\pi^{p_i}$ which is the $l$th element of $\varrho^{p_i}$ namely $\varrho^{p_i}[l]$. Assign a receding time $T_H$ for each agent, note that different agents have different velocity so each agent will adjust its velocity according to its speed. Assume that each agent could estimate the approximate time according its current velocity, departure position and target position, then the segment the agent expected to execute in $T_H$ is denoted by $\tau^{p_i}_H$, $\tau^{p_i}_H = \varrho^{p_i}[l:t]$, where the index $t$ is the solution of the following optimization problem: min $t$, subject to $\sum_{i=l}^{t}T^{p_i}(\varrho^{p_i}[i],\varrho^{p_i}[i+1])\geq T_H$, this issue can be solved by iterating through the $\varrho^{p_i}$ and computing the accumulated time which is compared to $T_H$. If previous optimization problem doesn't have a solution, it means that in $T_H$ the agent can execute the rest of the suffix of $\varrho^{p_i}$, namely $\varrho^{p_i}[l:]$. Since the split point of $\varrho^{p_i}$ has been indicated previously, original optimization problem can be transformed into a new optimization problem: min $t$, subject to $\sum_{i=\gamma}^{t}T^{p_i}(\varrho^{p_i}[i],\varrho^{p_i}[i+1])\geq T_H - \sum_{i=l}^{|\varrho^{p_i}|}T^{p_i}(\varrho^{p_i}[i],\varrho^{p_i}[i+1])$, where $|\varrho^{p_i}|$ denote the length of $\varrho^{p_i}$ and $\gamma$ denote the split point index. We can always find a solution to above problem iteratively.

\subsection{Online Coordination Scheme}
Through speed matching receding horizon planning, the truncation index is founded and the receding horizon motion plan $\varrho^{p_i}_H$ is synthesized. To ensure the fulfill of task specification $\varphi$, each agent needs to check whether it needs others' collaboration within $\varrho^{p_i}_H$. Since we have reconstituted the motion plan of each agent, we can just find the first item in $\varrho^{p_i}_H$ which has $req$ attribute.  After one agent confirms that it needs others' collaboration, a $\textbf{Request}^{p_i}$ is sent to others. More specifically, for the first item $<\pi_c^{p_i},req^{p_i}>\ \in \varrho^{p_i}_H$ satisfying $req \neq \emptyset$, where $c$ denote the index of $<\pi_c^{p_i},req^{p_i}>$ in $\varrho^{p_i}_H$. Agent $p_i$ needs to broadcast the request message to $\mathcal{N}^{p_i}$ through its communicate network. $\textbf{Request}^{p_i}$ has the following format:
$$\textbf{Request}^{p_i} = (\chi^{p_i},\pi_c^{p_i},T^{p_i}_e)$$
where $\chi^{p_i}$ denotes all the items in $req^{p_i}$, which indicates the collaborative motion agent $p_i$ needs in $\pi_c^{p_i}$, and $T^{p_i}_e$ denotes the estimated time spent from $\varrho^{p_i}[l]$ to $\varrho^{p_i}[c]$, namely $T^{p_i}_e=\sum_{i=l}^{c}T^{p_i}(\varrho^{p_i}_H[i],\varrho^{p_i}_H[i+1])$. Since $\varrho^{p_i}_H[c]$ is the predecessor of the first request state in $\varrho^{p_i}_H$, $\varrho^{p_i}_H[c]$ can be always reached within finite time, so $T^{p_i}_e$ is a finite positive number.
The algorithm finding out the first request in receding horizon motion plan $\varrho^{p_i}_H$ is as Algorithm 2.\par
