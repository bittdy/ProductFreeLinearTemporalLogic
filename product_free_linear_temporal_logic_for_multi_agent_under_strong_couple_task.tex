% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
We consider the collaboration under compact coupled task specifications of a multiagent system that consists of heterogeneous groups of homogeneous agents. To fight the extreme computational complexity of centralized multi-agent planning, we propose a decentralized solution, where couple-edge is proposed to eliminate the coupling among compact task and transform the collaboration issue into a local task planning problem. Meanwhile, we adapt the online coordination scheme based on real-time exchange of request and reply messages to ensure the satisfaction of task specifications without central coordination. This adapted online coordination scheme facilitates not only decreasing the total execution cost but also dispatching agents to strive to complete task when part of agents failure. Proposed approach is demonstrated by a simulated scenario of 14 agents under compact coupled task specifications.

% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.

\section{Preliminaries}

\subsection{Linear Temporal Logic}
Atomic propositions (AP) are boolean variables that can be either true or false and the ingredients of an linear temporal logic are a set of atomic propositions and several boolean and temporal operators, which are specified according to the following syntax[add ref]: $\varphi\ $$:$$:$$=\top|a|\varphi_1\wedge\varphi_2| \neg \varphi|\bigcirc\varphi|\varphi_1\cup\varphi_2|\Box\varphi|\Diamond\varphi|\Longrightarrow\varphi$, where $\top\ (\emph{True})$, $a\ \in AP$, $\bigcirc$ (\emph{Next}), $\cup$ (\emph{Until}), $\Box (\emph{Always})$,  $\Diamond (\emph{Eventually})$ and $\Longrightarrow (\emph{Implicate})$. We refer the readers to [add ref] to grasp the detailed semantics of LTL. We consider $\ \cup\ $, $\Longrightarrow$ and $\wedge$ in this paper which can combine the atomic propositions of different agents, thus generating the compact coupling task.


\subsection{B\"{u}chi Automaton}
Given a LTL formula $\varphi$, we can always translate it to a Nondeterministic B\"{u}chi Automaton (NBA) $\mathcal{A}_\varphi$ that accepts all the languages that satisfy $\varphi$. It is defined as $\mathcal{B}_\varphi=\ (Q,2^{AP},\delta,Q_0,\mathcal{F})$, where $Q$ is a finite set of all the states of B\"{u}chi Automaton, $2^{AP}$ is the set of alphabets, $\delta:\ Q\times 2^{AP}\rightarrow 2^Q$ is the transition relation and $\mathcal{F}\subseteq Q$ is the set of accepting states of B\"{u}chi Automaton. There are fast translation algorithms[add ref] to obtain $\mathcal{B}_\varphi$ from LTL formula $\varphi$.

\section{Problem Formulation}
We consider a multiagent system organized by $N\geq1$ agents. Each agent has the capabilities of navigating within the workspace and performing various motions. The agent index is denoted by $\mathcal{I}=\{p_i,i=1,2,...,N\}$. Then, we divide all the agents into different subsets according to their local LTL task specifications, which implies that only agents with the same local LTL task specifications can be divided into one subset. Assume there are $M$ subsets after dividing, denoted by $\mathcal{G}=\{g_j,j=1,2,...,M\}$. $\mathcal{G}$ satisfies: $g_s\subseteq \mathcal{I},\ \cup_{g_t\subseteq \mathcal{G}}g_t\ =\ \mathcal{I}$ and $g_s\cap g_t\ =\ \emptyset$, $\forall g_t,g_s \subseteq \mathcal{G}$.
\subsection{Motion Abstraction}
Each agent only knows a part of the full workspace which guarantees the completeness of local task and collaboration task. Towards each agent, its workspace consists of $L$ partitions, denoted by $\Pi^{p_i}=\{\pi_1,\pi_2,...,\pi_L\}$, assume all the partitions are known by agents a priori. Besides, there is a set of atomic propositions $\digamma^{p_i}$ describing the properties of the workspace of agent $p_i$. According to [add ref], the motion of $p_i$ is modeled as a finite transition system (FTS) as following[add ref]:
$$\mathcal{F}^{p_i}=(\Pi^{p_i},\rightarrow^{p_i},\Pi^{p_i}_0,L^{p_i},\digamma^{p_i})$$
where $\rightarrow^{p_i} \subseteq \Pi \times \Pi$ is the transition relation, $\Pi^{p_i}_0 \subseteq \Pi^{p_i}$ is the initial region, $L^{p_i}:\Pi^{p_i}\rightarrow 2^{\digamma^{p_i}}$ is the labeling function which indicates the properties held by each region. A path of $\mathcal{F}^{p_i}$ is a sequence of regions $\pi_0 \pi_1 ...\pi_s$ where $(\pi_k,\pi_{k+1})\in \rightarrow^{p_i}$, $\forall k=0,1,...,L-1$.
\subsection{Communication Model}
Similar to the communication model in [add ref], the communication network $\mathcal{V}=(\mathcal{N},\mathcal{E}(t))$ at $t>0$, where $\mathcal{N}$ is the set of nodes and $\mathcal{E}(t)\subseteq \mathcal{N} \times \mathcal{N}$ is the set of edges, which has two layers that $\mathcal{E}(t)=\mathcal{E}_1(t)\cup \mathcal{E}_2(t)$. The first layer $\mathcal{E}_1(t)={(p_i,p_j),\forall i,j\in g_t}$ and $\mathcal{E}_2(t)={(p_i,p_j),\forall i\in g_t,\forall j \in g_s, t\neq s}$. The first layer $\mathcal{E}_1(t)$ is static, which indicates that all the agents belong to the same group $g_t$ can always communicate with each other. The second layer $\mathcal{E}_2(t)$ is dynamic, which indicates that it is enabled when there are decentralized collaboration occurs.
\subsection{Complete Agent Model}
Given the NBA $\mathcal{B}^{p_i}$ associated with $\varphi^{p_i}$ and FTS $\mathcal{F}^{p_i}$, the complete agent model $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}$ of $p_i$ is defined as following:
$$\mathcal{C}^{p_i}=\mathcal{B}^{p_i}\otimes \mathcal{C}^{p_i}=(Q^{p_i,\ast},\delta^{p_i},Q^{p_i,\ast}_0,Q^{p_i,\ast}_{\mathcal{F}},W^{p_i,\ast},\tau^{p_i})$$
where $Q^{p_i,\ast}=\Pi^{p_i}\times Q^{p_i}$, $q^{p_i,\ast}=<\pi^{p_i},q^{p_i}>$, $\forall \pi^{p£»_i}\in \Pi^{p_i}$, $\forall q^{p_i}\in Q^{p_i}$; $(<\pi^{p_i}_m,q^{p_i}_s>,<\pi^{p_i}_n,q^{p_i}_t>)\in \delta^{p_i}$ if $\pi^{p_i}_m \rightarrow^{p_i} \pi^{p_i}_n$ and $(q^{p_i}_s,L^{p_i}(\pi^{p_i}_m),q^{p_i}_t)\in \delta^{p_i}$; $Q^{p_i,\ast}_0=\Pi^{p_i}_0\times Q_0^{p_i}$ is the set of initial states; $Q^{p_i,\ast}_{\mathcal{F}}=\Pi^{p_i}\times Q^{p_i}_\mathcal{F}$ is the set of accepting states; $W^{p_i,\ast}:\delta^{p_i}\times Q^{p_i,\ast}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{+}$. $W^{p_i,\ast}(<\pi^{p_i}_m,q^{p_i}_s>,<\pi^{p_i}_n,q^{p_i}_t>)=T^{p_i}(\pi^{p_i}_m,\pi^{p_i}_n)$ which is estimated by agent $p_i$, where $<\pi^{p_i}_n,q^{p_i}_t>\in \delta^{p_i}(<\pi^{p_i}_m,q^{p_i}_s>)$. $\tau^{p_i}$ indicates whether $(<\pi^{p_i}_m,q^{p_i}_s>,<\pi^{p_i}_n,q^{p_i}_t>)$ is a couple edge which is going to be introduced next.
\subsection{Compact Coupled Task Specification}
In this paper we consider the compact coupled task specification. Compared to loosely coupled task specifications, compact coupled task specifications relevant to the motions of two or more agents tightly, thus can't be translated to B\"{u}chi Automaton only according to the local agent model and action specification as previous method[add ref]. The compact coupled task specification takes an recursive definition as following.
\par
\emph{Definition 1:} Given a LTL formula $\varphi$ contains temporal operators such as $\cup \ $, $\Longrightarrow$ and  $\wedge$, we denote the terms around each temporal operators by $t^{left}_i$ and $t^{right}_i$, respectively. if $t^{left}_i$ and $t^{right}_i$ belongs to $AP$ of different agents or one of them is a compact coupled task specification, then we say $\varphi$ is a compact coupled task specification.
\par
In other words, a compact coupled task specification should combine the motions of different agents through $\cup \ $, $\Longrightarrow \ $, $\wedge$ so that we can't translate it to B\"{u}chi Automaton and synthesize an initial motion plan for each agent. In summary, we consider following problem.
\par
\emph{Problem 1:}  Given the complete agent model $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}$ and a serious of task specifications $\varphi$ which contain compact coupled task specifications, design a decentralized collaboration scheme such that $\varphi$ is fulfilled for all $p_i \ \subseteq \ \mathcal{I}$.
\section{Decentralized Initial Plan Synthesis}
In this section, we will demonstrate how we decouple the compact coupled task specifications through a set of special edge called couple-edge. Then we use the decoupled B\"{u}chi Automaton to synthesize an initial motion plan for each agent.
\subsection{Decoupling the Compact Coupled Task}
We consider the basic compact coupled task such as $\varphi_1 \cup (\varphi_2 \wedge \varphi_3)$ and $\varphi_1 \Longrightarrow \bigcirc(\varphi_2 \wedge \varphi_3)$, the nested compact coupled task can be transform to basic terms through utilizing auxiliary words. For example, we can transform $\varphi_1 \cup (\varphi_2 \Longrightarrow \bigcirc \varphi_3)$ into $\varphi_1 \cup \kappa$ and $\kappa=\varphi_2 \Longrightarrow \bigcirc \varphi_3$.
\par
Towards basic compact coupled task specification, we notice that compact coupling only exists in the task cooperation process and neither the motions nor states of agent directly participate in the construction of complete models of other agents. For example, consider compact coupled task specification $\neg \varphi_1\cup\varphi_2$, according to definition 1, $\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2$ belongs to different complete agent models. Consider the local complete agent model $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}$, of which the state set is $Q_c^{p_i}$ that $\varphi_1 \in Q_c^{p_i}|_{\mathcal{M}}$, and $\varphi_2 \notin Q_c^{p_i}|_{\mathcal{M}} $. There exists a subset of $Q_c^{p_i}$ denoted by $\epsilon$ that $\varphi_1 \in \epsilon |_{\mathcal{M}}$ and $\varphi_1 \notin Q_c^{p_i} \setminus \epsilon |_{\mathcal{M}}$. Then there is no edge from $Q_c^{p_i} \setminus \epsilon$ to $\epsilon$ so that we can't synthesize an initial motion plan fulfill $\varphi$.\par
\emph{Definition 2:} Given a complete agent model $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}$, If two nodes $q_i$, $q_j$ satisfy following properties:
\par
(1) $q_i \in \epsilon$, $q_j \in Q_c^{p_i} \setminus \epsilon$ or vice versa.\par
(2) $\delta(q_i,q_j)\subseteq sym(\varphi_c)$ or $\delta(q_j,q_i)\subseteq sym(\varphi_c)$.

where $\varphi_c$ denote the compact coupled part of task specification $\varphi$ and $sym(\varphi)$ denote all the atomic proposition of $\varphi$.
We call each edge which connects $q_i$ and $q_j$ the couple-edge.
At first we can assume that all the collaborative agents have provided assistance and add all the couple-edge to the local complete agent model, then we can synthesize an initial motion plan for each agent.\par
We adapt previous local product algorithm[add ref] which combines the FTS and B\"{u}chi Automaton of single agent for finding out all the couple-edge with respect to the compact coupled task specification $\varphi_c$ and add them into the origin complete agent model. Applying Algorithm 1 we can get a new complete agent model $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}_n$ for each agent, which contains $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}$ and all the couple-edges.\par
\begin{algorithm}

            $W_p(q'_s,q'_g)=W_c(\pi_i,\pi_j)$

            $\tau(q'_s,q'_g) = None$
        }
        \Else
        {
            \If{$L_c(\pi_i)\in sym(\varphi_c)$}
            {

                $W_p(q'_s,q'_g)=W_c(\pi_i,\pi_j)$

                $\tau(q'_s,q'_g)=L_c(\pi_i)$
            }
        }
    }
  }
  \Return $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}_n$
\end{algorithm}

\emph{Lemma 1:} By adding all the couple-edges found out by applying Algorithm 1 to $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}$, we can synthesize an initial accepted motion plan for each agent.\par
\emph{proof:} According to algorithm 1, the nodes in $Q_c^{p_i} \setminus \epsilon$ are connected because these nodes are correspond to independent task specifications. Through adding couple-edges into $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}$, each node in $\epsilon$ becomes reachable and $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}_n$ becomes fully connected. Consequently, there must exist spanning trees for $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}_n$ and there must exist a path from any initial node in $\Phi_0^{p_i}$ to any accepted node in $\Phi_A^{p_i}$. So we can synthesize an initial motion plan fulfilling $\varphi_c$ according to $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}_n$.
\subsection{Plan Synthesis and Reconstitution}
Given $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}_n$ and $\varphi^{p_i}$, there exists a finite path satisfying $\varphi^{p_i}$ if and only if $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}_n$ has a finite path from an initial state to an accepting state. This finite path can be projected back to $\mathcal{F}^{p_i}$ as a finite path. Let $R^{p_i}=q^{p_i}_0 q^{p_i}_1 ... q^{p_i}_s$ be a finite path, where $q^{p_i}_0\in Q_0$, $q^{p_i}_s\in Q_\mathcal{F}$ and $q^{p_i}_z\in Q$ and $(q^{p_i}_z,q^{p_i}_{z+1})\in \delta^{p_i}$. The $cost$ of $R^{p_i}$ is denoted by $cost(R^{p_i},\mathcal{C}^{p_i}_n)=\sum^{s}_{k=0}W^{p_i}(q^{p_i}_k,q^{p_i}_{k+1})$.[add ref] Apply [add ref, Algorithm 1] to find $R^{p_i}$, which utilizes Dijkstra algorithm [add ref] to find the shortest path from any initial state in $Q^{p_i}_0$ to every reachable accepting state in $Q_\mathcal{F}^{p_i}$.

\emph{Lemma 2:} This decentralized initial plan synthesis method has solutions as long as original centralized plan synthesis method has solutions.\par
\emph{Proof:} In algorithm 1 we assume that all the collaborative agents have provided assistance and add all the couple-edges into $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}$. Then towards $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}$, $\varphi_c$ is no longer a constraint. The constraint becomes $\varphi \setminus \varphi_c$. Assume we synthesize an initial motion plan $R$ applying original centralized plan synthesis method, $R$ fulfills $\varphi$ and then $R$ must fulfill $\varphi \setminus \varphi_c$, so all the solutions generated by original centralized method are contained in the solutions generated by decentralized method. Consequently, the proposed decentralized initial plan synthesis method has solutions as long as original centralized plan synthesis method has solutions.\par
$R^{p_i}$ constructed by [zhao na ge suan fa] is composed of prefix $R^{p_i}_p$ and suffix $R^{p_i}_s$. In order to adapt to next algorithms, $R^{p_i}$ is reconstituted as following:\par
(1)Merge $R^{p_i}_p$ and $R^{p_i}_s$ and use $\gamma$ to indicate the separation point.

(2)If two state nodes $q^{p_i}_s$ and $q^{p_i}_t$ satisfy the properties in $\emph{Definition 2}$, add $\delta(q^{p_i}_s,q^{p_i}_t)$ to the attribute $req^{p_i}$ of $q^{p_i}_s$.

\section{Decentralized Task Collaboration}
In previous section, we assume that all the collaborative agents have provided assistance and add all the couple-edges into $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}$, which permits us to synthesize an initial motion plan for each agent. If each agent runs on its own local path independently without any communication with other agents, there may be no guarantee that the collaborative task will be completed, which may result in a violation of the task specification $\varphi$. In response to this issue, we adapt the online coordination scheme to ensure the completion of the collaborative task.
\subsection{Planning In Speed Matching Horizon}
In order to reduce the complexity of task collaboration, we apply a receding horizon method for each agent. Consider the initial reconstituted motion plan $\varrho^{p_i}$ previous, assume the current position of agent $p_i$ is $\pi^{p_i}$ which is the $l$th element of $\varrho^{p_i}$ namely $\varrho^{p_i}[l]$. Assign a receding time $T_H$ for each agent, note that different agents have different velocity so each agent will adjust its velocity according to its speed. Assume that each agent could estimate the approximate time according its current velocity, departure position and target position, then the segment the agent expected to execute in $T_H$ is denoted by $\tau^{p_i}_H$, $\tau^{p_i}_H = \varrho^{p_i}[l:t]$, where the index $t$ is the solution of the following optimization problem: min $t$, subject to $\sum_{k=l}^{t}T^{p_i}(\varrho^{p_i}[k],\varrho^{p_i}[k+1])\geq T_H$, this issue can be solved by iterating through the $\varrho^{p_i}$ and computing the accumulated time which is compared to $T_H$. If previous optimization problem doesn't have a solution, it means that in $T_H$ the agent can execute the rest of the suffix of $\varrho^{p_i}$, namely $\varrho^{p_i}[l:]$. Since the split point of $\varrho^{p_i}$ has been indicated previously, original optimization problem can be transformed into a new optimization problem: min $t$, subject to $\sum_{k=\gamma}^{t}T^{p_i}(\varrho^{p_i}[k],\varrho^{p_i}[k+1])\geq T_H - \sum_{k=l}^{|\varrho^{p_i}|}T^{p_i}(\varrho^{p_i}[k],\varrho^{p_i}[k+1])$, where $|\varrho^{p_i}|$ denote the length of $\varrho^{p_i}$ and $\gamma$ denote the split point index. We can always find a solution to above problem iteratively.

\subsection{Online Coordination Scheme}
Through speed matching receding horizon planning, the truncation index is founded and the receding horizon motion plan $\varrho^{p_i}_H$ is synthesized. To ensure the fulfill of task specification $\varphi$, each agent needs to check whether it needs others' collaboration within $\varrho^{p_i}_H$. Since we have reconstituted the motion plan of each agent, we can just find the first item in $\varrho^{p_i}_H$ which has $req^{p_i}$ attribute.  After one agent confirms that it needs others' collaboration, a $\textbf{Request}^{p_i}$ is sent to others. More specifically, for the first item $<\pi_c^{p_i},req^{p_i}>\ \in \varrho^{p_i}_H$ satisfying $req \neq \emptyset$, where $c$ denote the index of $<\pi_c^{p_i},req^{p_i}>$ in $\varrho^{p_i}_H$. Agent $p_i$ needs to broadcast the request message to $\mathcal{N}^{p_i}$ through its communicate network. $\textbf{Request}^{p_i}$ has the following format:
$$\textbf{Request}^{p_i} = (\chi^{p_i},\pi_c^{p_i},T^{p_i}_e)$$
where $\chi^{p_i}$ denotes all the items in $req^{p_i}$, which indicates the collaborative motion agent $p_i$ needs in $\pi_c^{p_i}$, and $T^{p_i}_e$ denotes the estimated time spent from $\varrho^{p_i}[l]$ to $\varrho^{p_i}[c]$, namely $T^{p_i}_e=\sum_{k=l}^{c}T^{p_i}(\varrho^{p_i}_H[k],\varrho^{p_i}_H[k+1])$. Since $\varrho^{p_i}_H[c]$ is the predecessor of the first request state in $\varrho^{p_i}_H$, $\varrho^{p_i}_H[c]$ can be always reached within finite time, so $T^{p_i}_e$ is a finite positive number.\par
If agent $p_i$ proposes a request message and there is no reply message transitorily, all the collaborations $p_i$ requests are stored in $\mathcal{R}^{p_i}_c$, the current state $\varrho^{p_i}_r$ is stored.\par
The algorithm finding out the first request in receding horizon motion plan $\varrho^{p_i}_H$ is as Algorithm 2.\par
\begin{algorithm}

        \ForAll{$\chi^{p_i}\in req^{p_i}$}
        {
            add $(\chi^{p_i},\pi^{p_i}_c,T_m)$ to $\textbf{Request}^{p_i}$
        }

  }
  \Else

  }
  \Return $\varrho^{p_i}_H,\textbf{Request}^{p_i}$;
\end{algorithm}
Once there are request messages transmitted among agents, some agents should revise their motion plan to provide assistance. The procedure of determining which agent to respond to the request is quite similar with the algorithm proposed in [add ref], we only present a brief overview here and we refer the readers to [add ref] to grasp more detail. In order to provide collaboration, the collaborative agent needs to revise its motion plan temporarily. Assume current state of agent $p_j$ is $\varrho^{p_j}[l]$ and next accepting state is $\varrho^{p_j}[f]$, original motion plan from $\varrho^{p_j}[l]$ to $\varrho^{p_j}[f]$ is $R^{p_j}_-=\varrho^{p_j}[l:f]$ and the motion plan after revision is denoted by $R^{p_j}_+$, the index of the position in where agent $p_j$ provides collaboration is $m$. We require each agent to calculate the cost of providing assistance in order to decide which agent to collaborate. The $balanced$ cost is defined as following:
\[ \begin{split}
BalCost(R^{p_j}_+,&T^{p_i}_e,\mathcal{C}^{p_j})=\\
&|(\sum_{k=l}^{m}T^{p_j}(\varrho^{p_j}[k],\varrho^{p_j}[k+1])-T^{p_i}_e)|\\
&+\beta_{p_j} \times (Cost(R^{p_j}_+,\mathcal{C}^{p_j})-Cost(R^{p_j}_-,\mathcal{C}^{p_j}))
\end{split} \]
where the first part denotes the time gap between the agent which sends a request message arriving the position where needs collaboration and corresponding agent arrive the position where assistance is provided. Simply, the first part denotes the waiting time of multiagent system, which contains both the waiting time of request agent and reply agent. The second part denotes the additional cost of $R^{p_i}_+$ compared with $R^{p_i}_-$, and $\beta_{p_j}$ is a designed parameter as relative weighting. Instead of formulating the agent choice issue as an integer programming problem,[add ref], we transmit the balanced cost of each agent among the group $\mathcal{N}^{G}$, since each agent calculates its balanced cost in the same way, there must exist a consensus agent $p_{min}$ whose balanced cost is minimal and $p_{min}$ will be elected to reply to corresponding $\textbf{Request}^{p_i}$.\par
After $p_{min}$ is elected, we design an attribute of agent named $state^{p_i}$ which turns into $locked$ when agent $p_i$ is providing collaboration, otherwise $state^{p_i}$ is $normal$. Meanwhile, due to the property of compact coupled task, all the request messages that have time overlapping can be replied by a group of heterogeneous agents. So towards each request message $Request^{p_i}$, if there is already a group of agents ${p_i}$ whose $state^{p_i}$ are $locked$, ${p_i}$ automatically become the collaborative agents and the corresponding request message becomes invisible to other agents.\par
Towards some compact coupled task, such as agents can't across region $r_i$ until some agents reach region $r_j$, only a group of agents is needed to reply request messages from different agents. Hence if two request messages $\textbf{Request}^{p_i}$ and $\textbf{Request}^{p_j}$ have time overlapping and there is a group of agents $\partial$ replying one request messages, then $\partial$ is selected as the reply agents for the other request message $\textbf{Request}'$ and $\textbf{Request}'$ becomes invisible to other agents.\par
$R^{p_i}_+$ can be constructed by the $bidirectional Dijkstra$ algorithm which utilizes the function $bidirectional\_dijkstra()$ in $Networkx$, we refer the readers to [add ref] for more details. After the reply agent $p_r$ is elected, when $p_i$ reaches the requested replying position and provides collaboration, there is a reply message sent from the reply agent to request agent, whose format is as following:
$$\textbf{Reply}^{p_r}=(p_r,p_i,\xi)$$
where $p_r$ denotes the grade of replying agent and $\xi$ denotes the collaboration provided.\par
Finally, we adapt the purpose and structure of $\textbf{Confirm}^{p_i}$ to suit the compact coupled task specification. The format of confirm message is as following:
$$\textbf{Confirm}^{p_i}=(p_i,p_r,\hat{\xi})$$
where $p_r$ denotes the grades of all replying agents and $\hat{\xi}$ denotes that $p_i$ has relieved collaboration requirements for action $\hat{\xi}$. It is sent when the agents which send the request message separate themselves from the area where the collaboration is required and enter next state and the confirm messages informs the replying agents to recovery their $state^{p_r}$ from $locked$ to $normal$. Denote all the request, reply and confirm messages which agent $p_i$ received by $\textbf{Request}_{p_i}^{\ast}$, $\textbf{Reply}_{p_i}^{\ast}$, $\textbf{Confirm}_{p_i}^{\ast}$, respectively. The entire algorithm to handle request, reply and confirm messages is as Algorithm 3.

\begin{algorithm}

    }
  }
  \Return{$R^{p_j}_+$}
\end{algorithm}
Only if $\mathcal{R}^{p_i}_c$ is empty and $state^{p_i}$ is $normal$, agent $p_i$ can continue to execute its motion plan, otherwise $p_i$ needs to wait for the completion of collaboration.
\section{Agent Scheduling System}
Even if we drive the agents according to above framework, there will still be some issues. This section we consider these issues and construct a agent scheduling system to further revise the motion plan of agents.
\subsection{Prevention Of Long-time Demission}
Suppose there are many agents engaged in a same task and request messages are raised frequently, which will cause the agents responding to the first request message to be stuck in the position, where the collaboration is provided, for a long time according to above framework. To prevent long-time demission, a ultimate time $T_u$ is specified, meaning that collaboration provided by one agent can only be sustained within ultimate time. Next we will elaborate how to elect an alternative to current collaborative agent in a group of homogeneous agents and minimize the overall cost.\par
The agent will record the time that it has spent to provide assistance once it begins to collaborate, the time is denoted by $T_{p_i}^{\ast}$. When $T_{p_i}^{\ast}>T_u$, agent $p_i$ must return to its own task, if $T_u-T_{p_i}^{\ast}<T_H$, it means agent $p_i$ needs to return within $\varrho^{p_i}_H$, then a succession signal is sent to all the homogeneous agents in group $\mathcal{N}^G$. Redefine the $balanced\ cost$ as following:
\[ \begin{split}
BalCost(R^{p_j}_+,&T_u,T_{p_i}^{\ast},\mathcal{C}^{p_j})=\\
&|(\sum_{k=l}^{m}T^{p_j}(\varrho^{p_j}[k],\varrho^{p_j}[k+1])-(T_u-T_{p_i}^{\ast}))|\\
&+\beta_{p_j} \times (Cost(R^{p_j}_+,\mathcal{C}^{p_j})-Cost(R^{p_j}_-,\mathcal{C}^{p_j}))
\end{split} \]
?????????jia gong shi suo yin

where the meaning of notations in [2] are the same as the notations in [3]. The agent $p_j$ that minimizes [2] in group $\mathcal{N}^G$ is elected to succeed $p_i$.\par
Suppose the message corresponding to the most recent request is $\textbf{Request}^{p_r}=(\chi^{p_r},\pi_c^{p_r},T^{p_r}_e)$, denote $\sum_{k=l}^{m}T^{p_j}(\varrho^{p_j}[k],\varrho^{p_j}[k+1]$ by $T_{p_j}^{\ast}$, if $T_{p_j}^{\ast}<T^{p_r}_e$, $state^{p_i}$ can be set as $normal$ and $p_i$ can go back to complete its own task, otherwise $p_i$ needs to wait for the arrival of successor. During the period between stopping collaboration and returning to its own task, agent $p_i$ doesn't accept any request messages in case of being elected as collaborative agent again.
\subsection{Failure Signal Transmission And Agents Dispatching}
Suppose there are several weak agents that are prone to breakdown, in this section we introduce how to mobilize other agents to inherit the task of weak agents when breakdown occurs to maximize task completion. At first, we define a virtual order $\mathcal{O}$ which indicates the importance of each individual task that each agent undertakes, towards agent $p_i$, if its task is more important, or the agents number in $g_j$ where $p_i \in g_j$ is few, the $\mathcal{O}_{p_i}$ is larger. Assume $\mathcal{O}_{p_i}\succ \mathcal{O}_{p_j}$, then when $p_i$ is breakdown, $p_j$ needs to revise its motion plan to inherit the task of $p_i$, otherwise $p_j$ still fixes on its own task.\par
When $p_i$ is broken down, there is a $\textbf{Warning}^{p_i}$ message sent to all the other agents, the format of $\textbf{Warning}^{p_i}$ is as following:
$$\textbf{Warning}^{p_i} = (p_i,\mathcal{C}^{p_i},\aleph^{p_i})$$
which means $p_i$ needs to broadcast its grade $p_i$, local complete agent model $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}$ and capacity $\aleph^{p_i}$ when it is broken down. After $\textbf{Warning}^{p_i}$ is broadcast, all the agents are qualified for capacity $\aleph^{p_i}$, denoted by $\nu$, will respond to the $\textbf{Warning}^{p_i}$. All the agents in $\nu$ with the same minimal $\mathcal{O}_{p_j}$ become candidates for inheriting the task of $p_i$. In order to elect an agent to respond to the warning message and revise its motion plan, we need to solve following problem:\par
\emph{Problem 2:} With a little symbol abuse, assume the motion plan of $p_j$ after revision is $R^{p_j}_+$ and the original one is $R^{p_j}_-$. Given the local complete agent model $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}$ and $\mathcal{C}^{p_j}$, decide the grade $\varpi$ of the agent inheriting the task of $p_i$ and construct $R^{\varpi}_+$ to minimize the total cost. \par
$\mathcal{C}^{p_i}$ and $\mathcal{C}^{p_j}$ can be combined to obtain $union\ agent\ model$. Assume that part of the local FTS $\mathcal{F}^{p_i}$ and $\mathcal{F}^{p_j}$ of $p_i$ and $p_j$ are bordered and then the construction procedure of union agent model $\widetilde{\mathcal{U}}_{ij}$ is as following:\par
(1)Add all the nodes and edges in $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}$ and $\mathcal{C}^{p_j}$ into $\widetilde{\mathcal{U}}_{ij}$.\par
(2)Find all the position pair $\tilde{s}=(\tilde{\eta}_{p_i},\tilde{\eta}_{p_j})$, where $\tilde{\eta}_{p_i}$ and $\tilde{\eta}_{p_j}$ appertain to $\mathcal{F}^{p_i}$ and $\mathcal{F}^{p_j}$, respectively and they are bordered, which means agent can transition from $\tilde{\eta}_{p_i}$ to $\tilde{\eta}_{p_j}$ by one step and vice versa. We call these position pair bordered position pair and denote the set of $\tilde{\eta}_{p_i}$ and $\tilde{\eta}_{p_j}$ by $\hat{\eta}_{p_i}$ and $\hat{\eta}_{p_j}$, respectively.\par
(3)For all nodes $\tilde{c}_{p_i}$ and $\tilde{c}_{p_j}$ in $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}$ and $\mathcal{C}^{p_j}$, if $\tilde{c}_{p_i}|_\mathcal{M}$ and $\tilde{c}_{p_j}|_\mathcal{M}$ is a bordered position pair and there are no violations of task specifications when transferring from $\tilde{c}_{p_i}|_\mathcal{M}$ to $\tilde{c}_{p_j}|_\mathcal{M}$, then we add an edge $(\tilde{c}_{p_i},\tilde{c}_{p_j},weight)$ into $\widetilde{\mathcal{U}}_{ij}$, where $weight$ denotes the distance between $\tilde{c}_{p_i}|_\mathcal{M}$ and $\tilde{c}_{p_j}|_\mathcal{M}$. If the transition violates the coupled task specifications and $(\tilde{c}_{p_i},\tilde{c}_{p_j})$ is a couple-edge according to \emph{Definition 2}, then add $(\tilde{c}_{p_i},\tilde{c}_{p_j},weight)$ as a couple-edge into $\widetilde{\mathcal{U}}_{ij}$.\par
After the union agent model is constructed, we decide $\varpi$ and synthesize $R^{\varpi}_+$. Assume $\mathcal{O}_{p_i}\succ \mathcal{O}_{p_j}$, then $p_j$ needs to revise its motion plan to inherit the task of $p_i$ when $p_i$ is broken down. Denote the current state of $p_j$ is $\tilde{c}_{p_j}^{\ast}$, $p_j$ needs to interrupt its own task so that the states of B\"{u}chi Automaton can no longer restrict the motion of $p_j$ and each $\tilde{c}_{p_j}$ satisfying $\tilde{c}_{p_j}|_\mathcal{M}=\tilde{c}_{p_j}^{\ast}|_\mathcal{M}$ can be the departure point of $R^{\varpi}_+$. It is obvious that the suffix $R^{\varpi,s}_+$ is invariant due to the inheriting of task specification $\varphi_i$, so we can transform the $\emph{Problem 2}$ to the synthesizing of prefix $R^{\varpi,p}_+$ from any $\tilde{c}_{p_j}$ satisfying $\tilde{c}_{p_j}|_\mathcal{M}=\tilde{c}_{p_j}^{\ast}|_\mathcal{M}$ to $\tilde{c}_{p_i}$ where $\tilde{c}_{p_i}|_\mathcal{M}\in \hat{\eta}_{p_i}$ and $\tilde{c}_{p_i}|_\mathcal{B}\in \mathcal{I}^{p_i}????chushi zhuangtai$. We apply $bidirectional Dijkstra$ method to synthesize $R^{\varpi,p}_+$, where all the $\tilde{c}_{p_j}$ satisfying $\tilde{c}_{p_j}|_\mathcal{M}=\tilde{c}_{p_j}^{\ast}|_\mathcal{M}$ are set as source nodes and all $\tilde{c}_{p_i}$ satisfying $\tilde{c}_{p_i}|_\mathcal{M}\in \hat{\eta}_{p_i}$ and $\tilde{c}_{p_i}|_\mathcal{B}\in \mathcal{I}^{p_i}????chushi zhuangtai$ are set as target nodes and we can obtain the shortest path between two nodes from source nodes and target nodes, ultimately, the shortest path in all the shortest paths is selected as $R^{\varpi,p}_+$. Then $R^{\varpi,p}_+$ is synthesized:(????zhe kuai you wen ti,shi zhao dao initial de ,hai shi zai suffix zhong mei ge jie dian kai shi shuang xiang zhao, ran hou na ge dian zuo wei qie ru dian)
$$R^{\varpi}_+ = R^{\varpi,p}_+\oplus R^{\varpi,s}_+$$ ???????gei R quan jia shang ji qi ren jiao biao

Then all the candidates of inheriting the task need to elect the agent with minimal cost to revise its motion plan, namely, they need to solve the minimal problem: min $Cost(R^{\varpi}_+)$, subject to $\sum b^{p_j}=1$.\par
When the broken down agent is fixed properly, we can drive the inheriting agent to return to its own task by reversing above method. The entire procedure of constructing the union agent model and each candidate finds out $R^{\varpi}_+???jia jiao biao$ is exhibited by Algorithm 4.

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{identify Row Context}
  \KwIn{$r_i$, $Backgrd(T_i)$=${T_1,T_2,\ldots ,T_n}$ and similarity threshold $\theta_r$}
  \KwOut{$con(r_i)$}
  $con(r_i)= \Phi$\;
  \For{$j=1;j \le n;j \ne i$}
  {
    float $maxSim=0$\;
    $r^{maxSim}=null$\;
    \While{not end of $T_j$}
    {
      compute Jaro($r_i,r_m$)($r_m\in T_j$)\;
      \If{$(Jaro(r_i,r_m) \ge \theta_r)\wedge (Jaro(r_i,r_m)\ge r^{maxSim})$}
      {
        replace $r^{maxSim}$ with $r_m$\;
      }
    }
    $con(r_i)=con(r_i)\cup {r^{maxSim}}$\;
  }
  return $con(r_i)$\;
\end{algorithm}

\section{Overall Structure}
Given the task specification $\varphi^{p_i}$ and FTS $\mathcal{F}^{p_i}$ of each agent, we decouple the compact coupled task specification and construct new complete agent model $\mathcal{C}^{p_i}_n$ through applying Algorithm. The initial motion path $R^{p_i}$ of each agent $p_i$ can be synthesized and we plan in speed matching horizon to reduce the complexity of task collaboration. To guarantee the completeness of collaboration task, an online coordination scheme is adapted to revise the initial motion path of each agent, where the collaboration task is completed through $\textbf{Request}^{p_i}$, $\textbf{Reply}^{p_i}$ and $\textbf{Confirm}^{p_i}$ messages. Corresponding to the properties of compact coupled task, we propose an agent scheduling system to prevent long-time demission and dispatch agents to strive to complete task when part of agents failure. The agent scheduling system is triggered by specific conditions, such as the ultimate time $T_u$ is reached or $\textbf{Warning}^{p_i}$ messages are transmitted through communication network, while the online coordination system is running.
\section{Case Study}
Consider the logistics system in a depot, there are three groups of agents assigned three different task specifications. For simplicity, denote the agents by $g_k={p_{i,k},i=1,2,...},\forall k=1,2,3$. The algorithms proposed are implemented and simulated on a laptop (i5-7300HQ, 2.50GHz Duo CPU and 8GB RAM).
\subsection{Workspace Description}
The environment of depot is shown in Fig.\ref{envir} and the initial positions of agents are as shown in Fig.\ref{initial}. The blue strips are the conveyor belts in the depot which occupy the space and agents cannot across them, and the regions labeled as $ti$ and $mi$ ($i=1,2,...,6$) are checkpoints around the conveyor belts where the agents working on belts need to visit frequently to ensure the belts work properly. Two groups of agents which are silver in Fig.\ref{initial} are responsible for the work on the conveyor belts and need to take care of the switch which is labeled by $o$ and $o'$. The regions associated with these two groups are painted yellow and green. A group of agents which are red in Fig.\ref{initial} are assigned to collect goods in $g$, move across the door $d$ and place the goods at the cargo collection point which is labeled $r$. The regions associated with them are painted gray.\par
The switches in gray control the door $d$ and when the switch is open, it will change to yellow. Only if $o$ and $o'$ are open simultaneously, the door is open and agents can move across it. If an agent sends request message, it will change to blue, meanwhile, if there is an agent reply the request message, it will change to black and there will be a red line connect them. In Fig.\ref{initial}, the agent in $r$ has sent a request message because it intends to move across the door $d$, and we can see there are two agents turn to black to reply the request message and there are two red lines connect each of them to the request agent.

\label{first}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Task Specification}
Three different tasks are assigned to three groups of agents. The task of agents working on conveyor belts is specified as ($\square\Diamond t1 \wedge \square\Diamond t2 \wedge \square\Diamond t3 \wedge \square\Diamond t4 \wedge \square\Diamond t5 \wedge \square\Diamond t6 \wedge \square(\neg b)$) and ($\square\Diamond m1 \wedge \square\Diamond m2 \wedge \square\Diamond m3 \wedge \square\Diamond m4 \wedge \square\Diamond m5 \wedge \square\Diamond m6 \wedge \square(\neg b)$) which means that they need to often eventually bie de lun wen zen me biao shu????? visit all the checkpoints and never move across the conveyor belts. The task of agents which need to collect goods and place them in cargo collection point is specified as ???zai kan zhe ge ren wu ($\square\Diamond g \wedge \square(g\Longrightarrow \Diamond r) \wedge \square(\neg b) \wedge \square(\neg d \cup (o \wedge) o')$), which means the goods collection agents need to often eventually kan bie de lun wen zen me biao shu???????? visit $g$ and when they collect goods in $g$, they need go to $r$ to place them. The goods collection agents can never move across the belts and only when the switches are both open can they move across the door $d$. We can see $\square(\neg r \cup (o \wedge) o')$ is the compact coupled task $\varphi_c$ because only two switches are both open can the goods collection agents move across the door.
