# ProductFreeLinearTemporalLogic
>Now don't need to product all the Buchi automata of multi-agent
## decouple of product automata
>Through specifying couple task, we can distinguish the couple edges
1.How to find couple edges
2.Prove: The decouple product automata doesn't damage the completeness of solutions
3.Construct the motion path for the RRC(request-reply-confirm) connect 
## request-reply-confirm
>To complete the fully distribute, we design a communication mechanism called 'request-reply-confirm'
1.Receding horizon: find the nearest request
2.Solve optimization problem to find which agent to reply corresponding request(How about multi-request)
3.After the confirm of agent, what to do next?
